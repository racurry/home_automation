# 2019-12-31 - Setting up home assistant

I have been frustrated with Hubitat.  It has given me wildly inconistent results in device support and automations. It's slow as hell. Everything needs to be a half-supported integration script written by some dude on the internet.  Stuff just doesn't work half the time.  I am giving up.

I'm going to try out Home Assistant.  My new raspberry pi showed up today.  I'm setting it up with [Bruh's new 'guide'](https://www.bruhautomation.io/2020-smart-home-installing-home-assistant/), which isn't much, but seems to have gotten me something.

Got done today:
- Installed hassio using applepi baker
- Set up all rooms and Hue bulbs
- Set up my one single chromecast
- Installed SSH Add ons
- Installed Node-Red (had to set `"ssl": false`)
- Set up spotify - actually read the instructions to be successful here.
