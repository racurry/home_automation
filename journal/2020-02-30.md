Installer installed it.  I tried to set things up on the web, and it took a dump and wouldn't work.  Bad job, ecobee.

Eventually I set my account up through the app.  The actual app is nice.

Adding it to Home Assistant was not dead-simple, but is quick and [well documented](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ecobee/).

No actual automations or smarts done.
