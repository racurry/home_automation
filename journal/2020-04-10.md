# Fri Apr 10 2020 Struggles With Hostnames & Alexa Media Player


## Hostname woes
I am struggling through HA's corporate renaming.  They renamed HASSIO to Home Assistant and Home Assistant to Home Assistant Core, for some assinine reason.  As part of this, one of the HASSIO updates changed hostnames from hassio.local to homeassistant.local.  Fine.

Today I did a bugfix update to Home Assistant Core, and everything went to hell.  For no apparent reason, my hostname switched back to hassio.local.  It was by pure chance I discovered it at all.  I thought I was going to have to
completely trash my set up, because I couldn't get anything to work as expected.


## Alexa Media Player
I installed Alexa Media Player using HACS.  I couldn't set it up with the integration; it kept promising
to send me a text, and it never came.  I had to go to Amazon.com and turn on 2FA, then try again.  It worked this time!
This will make it more of a pain in the ass to actually use Amazon.

Also, since I have a billion Amazon devices, my auto-generated dashboard is now garbage.  Also I can't figure out how to control it.  Also the TTS slot in the cards don't work; they make my echos tell me to use `media_player.sometotherthing`.
