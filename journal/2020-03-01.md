# Sun 2020-03-01 - Flic hub more like dick hub

I have a Flic hub, now.  Hub is installed, paired to one button.

I spent one million years trying to figure out how to turn on the http integration so I could call an endpoint when the Flic gets pressed.  After a lot of stupid digging, I looked in config.yml and discovered its already on.

Generating a long-lived access token on `/profile` allows me to call my server with

```
 curl -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://HOSTNAME:PORT
```

Trying something similar to what [this user recommended](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/flic-hub-intergration/55253/21), I came up totally empty.  I can curl everything just fine, but using Flic's "Internet Request" to build the request doesn't seem to _do_ anything, even testing by changing the URL to a pasteb.in.

I reached out to their support.  In the mean time, I've directly integrated Harmony, WeMo and Hue to turn some stuff off.
